LinkSight AI ðŸ§ âœ¨
Transform LinkedIn job descriptions into actionable career intelligence.

LinkSight AI is a browser extension and web app that uses AI to deconstruct dense job postings into clear summaries, key requirements, and personalized action plans, helping you navigate your job search with speed and clarity.

## About The Project
The modern job search is overwhelming. Job seekers spend countless hours sifting through jargon-filled job descriptions to identify core requirements and figure out how to stand out. LinkSight AI was built to solve this problem.

With a single click, our Chrome extension analyzes a LinkedIn job post and uses a powerful AI model to provide you with:

A concise summary of the role.

A clean, bulleted list of the most important requirements.

A personalized action plan with concrete steps to meet those requirements.

All your analyses are saved to a personal dashboard that doubles as a powerful job tracker, allowing you to manage your application pipeline from "Applied" to "Offer."
